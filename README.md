# Dummy Infection Data Generator

The details about how to generate some dummy data are in `Data Generation Test.ipynb` (_Why did I call it a test, I wonder?_). Sample data (100 days, population size = 500) can be found in the .csv files.

## Dependencies

If you use Poetry, that's great. Simply run `poetry install` and you should be good to go. Otherwise, you will need to install:

- SciPy
- NumPy
- Jupyter (duh)
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
